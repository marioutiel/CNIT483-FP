# NBA Player Statline Predictor

This is a project that uses machine learning to predict the sum of points, rebounds, and assists for NBA players in a given game. The project includes several scripts for web-scraping betting odds, player data, and team statistics, as well as for predicting player statlines and checking the results.

## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have Python 3 and several Python packages installed, including LightGBM, Beautiful Soup, and Requests. You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install lightgbm beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## Usage

To use this project, you will need to run several scripts in the following order:

1. `NBA_Odds.ipynb` - This script scrapes the betting odds from a betting site for the next night of NBA games. You should run this script every day to get the latest odds.

2. `NBA_Players.ipynb` - This script scrapes the data for all NBA players that play in the league. You only need to run this script once to get the player data.

3. `NBA_Teams.ipynb` - This script scrapes the data for every NBA team's performance and statistics for the current season. You should run this script every day to get the latest team stats.

4. `Preds.ipynb` - This script uses machine learning to predict the sum of points, rebounds, and assists for NBA players in a given game. The script applies different ML techniques and uses LightGBM Regressor as the model.

5. `Evaluate_Preds.ipynb` - This script scrapes the previous night's game data to check the results and contrast them with the predictions made in `Preds.ipynb`.
